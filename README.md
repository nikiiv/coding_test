**Algorithm to find if a sub-list exists into a given list if all elements sum to a target number**


  > Implement a function that will determinate if exists a range of
  > non-negative elements in an array that sum up to a specific non-
  > negative number
  >
  > Example 1 - targetSum 3, numbers = [1,7,1,1,1,5,6,1] - output true (the sum of the elements in range 2 to 4 is 3
  > Example 2 - targetSum 7, numbers = [0,4,5,1,8,9,12,3,1] - output false (no range sums to 7)
